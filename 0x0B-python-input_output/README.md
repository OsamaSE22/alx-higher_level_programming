# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## üìò Project Overview

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum.  
It focuses on file handling and JSON serialization/deserialization in Python ‚Äî key concepts for data persistence and I/O operations.

You will learn how to read and write files, manage file cursors, use the `with` statement effectively, and work with JSON to serialize and deserialize Python data structures.
