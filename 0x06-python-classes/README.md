# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This project introduces the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
It covers how to define classes, create objects, manage attributes, and implement encapsulation, abstraction, and properties.  
The tasks are designed to build a strong foundation in OOP step by step.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without using Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome  
- What Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is  
- The concept of “first-class everything” in Python  
- What a class is and how to define it  
- What an object/instance is and the difference between a class and an instance  
- What attributes are, and how to define public, protected, and private attributes  
- The purpose of `self` in Python classes  
- What a method is and how to define it  
- The role of the special `__init__` method (constructor)  
- Concepts of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding  
- What a property is and how it differs from a regular attribute  
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters using `@property`  
- How to dynamically create new attributes for instances  
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes  
- What the `__dict__` attribute of a class/instance contains  
- How Python looks up attributes of an object or class  
- How to use the built-in `getattr()` function

## Project Structure
All files are located in the directory:  
`0x06-python-classes`

Each file contains a task that builds upon the previous one:

- **0-square.py** – Empty class `Square`  
- **1-square.py** – Square with private attribute `size`  
- **2-square.py** – Size validation with `TypeError` and `ValueError`  
- **3-square.py** – Method `area()` to compute the square’s area  
- **4-square.py** – Getter and setter for private attribute `size`  
- **5-square.py** – Method `my_print()` to print the square with `#`  
- **6-square.py** – Adds `position` attribute and enhanced printing  

---

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3 (3.8.5)`  
- All files should end with a new line  
- The first line of all files must be:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
