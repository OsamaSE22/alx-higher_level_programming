# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and handling **exceptions** in Python. Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. Learning how to handle them properly is essential for writing robust and error-tolerant code.  

You will implement various functions that demonstrate safe printing, catching exceptions, raising errors, and using clean-up actions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome  
- The difference between **errors** and **exceptions**  
- What exceptions are and how to use them  
- When exceptions are needed  
- How to correctly handle an exception  
- The purpose of catching exceptions  
- How to raise a built-in exception  
- When to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Requirements
- **Editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.5  
- All files must:  
  - Start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
  - End with a new line  
  - Follow **pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)**  
  - Be executable  
- No importing of external modules unless specified  
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`
