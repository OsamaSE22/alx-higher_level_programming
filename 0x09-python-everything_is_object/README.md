# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description
This project dives deep into one of the core ideas of Python: **everything in Python is an object**.  
You will explore how Python handles variables, objects, references, assignments, and how mutability affects behavior.  
The tasks focus on answering theoretical questions about Pythonâ€™s object model and require you to think carefully before testing in the interpreter.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without using external resources:

- Why Python programming is awesome.
- What is an object.
- The difference between a **class** and an **object/instance**.
- The difference between **immutable** and **mutable** objects.
- What a **reference** is in Python.
- What **assignment** means in Python.
- What an **alias** is and how it affects variables.
- How to check if two variables are identical.
- How to check if two variables are linked to the same object.
- How to display the variable identifier (memory address in CPython).
- Which Python types are **mutable** and which are **immutable**.
- How Python passes variables to functions.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- All files must end with a newline.
- First line of all scripts: `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code must follow **pycodestyle (2.8.\*)**.
- All files must be executable.
- File length will be tested with `wc`.

### Answer Files
- Only one line.
- No shebang.
- Must end with a newline.

---

## Usage
The project is mainly **Q&A based**.  
Each answer must be placed in its corresponding `.txt` file with exactly one line.  
For Python scripts, make sure they are executable and respect the required format.

## Example
```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> a[0] = 'x'
>>> b
['x', 2, 3]
