# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## üìñ Description
This project is part of the **ALX Higher Level Programming** curriculum.  
It focuses on deepening the understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, with emphasis on classes, attributes, methods, and special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.).

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What is OOP and why it is powerful in Python.
- The difference between classes and objects/instances.
- Class attributes vs. instance attributes.
- Public, protected, and private attributes.
- How to use properties (getters/setters) the Pythonic way.
- The role of special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__del__`).
- Class methods, static methods, and how to bind attributes.
- How Python resolves attributes (`__dict__`, `getattr`, etc.).
